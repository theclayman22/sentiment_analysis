# Sentiment Analysis Toolkit

This repository contains a minimal skeleton for a modular sentiment analysis toolkit.
It provides separate packages for configuration, analyzers, models, utilities and a
Streamlit based user interface. Each module is implemented as a lightweight
placeholder to demonstrate the intended architecture.

## Running the app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Running tests

```bash
pytest
```
